    "**Karaoke** is one of the most popular recreational activity in Japan. It can be enjoyed alone, with family or friends, or even with strangers. Karaoke is usually combined with wide varieties of other recreation activities such as bowling or billiard, or with just common food and drink bars. It can be thought as a combined business of sorts wherein you can profit not only from karaoke machines but also profit from food/drink bars, and other services offered. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important element in setting up a business is how you position your business in the market. And in a Karaoke business, physical location is very important. Principally situated in the cluster of shops, near train stations, near lively night streets and the like, one cannot stress enough that human traffic is the soul of this business. Aside from this, starting a Karaoke business has to consider many factors such as ease of access, safety and customer perception to the location, laws and regulations, and possible business competition.\n"
